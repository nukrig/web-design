            <h1>DESIGN YOUR HOUSE</h1>
            <p>Before you start designing your home, you have to decide where to put it.
                Where the house sits on the property and how its oriented will affect the design of your homes interior. For example, some sides of the house will get more natural light than others, and that might influence where you place each room. <br>efore you make any decisions, familiarize yourself with local building codes. There may be restrictions on where and how you can construct your house.<br>hink about energy savings. In a cool climate, direct sun will reduce heating costs. In a warmer climate, placing the house in a spot with more shade is advantageous. <br>rees and tall hedges can provide shade and a barrier against the wind. Don’t forget that smaller trees will get bigger and block more sunlight. Unless you’re removing the trees, allow them space to grow.
                Hills on the lot can affect drainage and sewage lines. If you’re at the bottom of a hill, rainwater runoff has to be directed away from your home’s foundation. If you’re at the top of a hill, you may need to install a sewage pump. Both can add to your costs.
                Consider how you’ll access your home. Additional grading or a long driveway can also add to expenses. If you think you’ll want additional buildings on your property in the future, such as a shed, think about how they’ll sit in relation to the home. <br> FInally, think about the view. What do you want to see out the window while you sip your morning coffee?</p>
